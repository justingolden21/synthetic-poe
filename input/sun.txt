There is a house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
And its been the ruins of many a poor boy
And god I know Im one
My mother was a taylor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin?man
Way down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time you keep him satisfied
Is when hes all a drunk
Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your life in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun
I got one foot on the platform
The other on a train
And Im goin?back to New Orleans
To swing that ball and chain
Yeah, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
And its been the ruins of many a poor boy
And God I know Im one
